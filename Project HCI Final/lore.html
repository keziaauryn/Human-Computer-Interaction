            <h4>
                Haihechi Mishima is a strong man from a great army leader. He married a women named Kuzami.
                They have a children named Kuyaza.
                Later Haihechi found out his wife is a devil and eventually he fights and killed her. 
                Believing his son shares the same devil genes as his mother, he took Kuyaza to the top of the cliff and tell him
                that he killed his mother.

            <h4>
                Hearing his father betrayal, Kuyaza fights him. Since he was still a little kid, Haihechi easily defeats Kuyaza and attempts
                to kill him by throwing him off the cliff.

            <h4>
                Kuyaza survived this because he indeed shares his mother's devil genes. Haihechi starts a tournament to test his strength
                with fighters from around the world. The winner will get a big amount of money as the reward. No one have ever defeated him.
                Until one day, Kuyaza comes to seek for revenge.
