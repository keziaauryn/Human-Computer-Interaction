                He is a The Mallo so that comes with the perks of Mallo chars with a dominating space control with EWGF, hard-hitting lows, 
                and a wavedash which allows him to cover the gap between himself and the opponent at his own pace and allows him to vary

            <h4>
                Once he is in your face, he has access to some of the best mids in the game to allow him to score CHs on his opponents and
                harass them with jab strings. However he does lack low pokes meaning he relies more game to open his opponents up.

        <div class="story1">
            <h4>
                The Dji is arguably the biggest turtle in the series. He has huge reach on his arms allowing him to effectively keep the 
                opponent out with jabs and mids. His main low pokes are extremely fast at i12, do good damage as well as granting decent 
                frame adv on hit.

        </div>
        <div class="story1">
            <h4>
                If Dji has you trapped at the wall, be prepared to lose quite a bit of life fighting out of his poke game. For a defensive
                character, he plays the passive aggressive game pretty well and can keep up with a fast paced game.

        <div class="story1">
            <h4>
                The Wan is the 50/50 powerhouse of the game. Wan is a character that wants to be in his opponent’s face constantly and 
                enforcing hard hitting mixups on them. Between his demoman (a damaging knock-down low) and a variety of mids, he puts 
                the fear into the opponent.

        </div>
        <div class="story1">
            <h4>
                Since he only knocks-down point blank, it is encouraged to take the opponent to the wall as soon as possible 
                as Wan, as they cannot backdash away from the demoman allowing him to loop his mixups.

        </div>
        <div class="story1">
            <h4>
                The Mond is a pretty relentless character in T7 in terms of pressure tools. He has the best approach tools of any character
                 with his WR2, a hugely + on block mid that CH launches. It can be scary to approach Dragunov as it is a very flexible tool 
                 in terms of rushdown + keepout. 
            </h4>
            
        </div>
        <div class="story1">
            <h4>
                He has access to a low launcher which is very hard to see and this goes hand in hand with his strong approach. Outside of 
                his WR2, Mond has some very strong mids to use upclose for keeping + frames on the opponent and keeping them in check.
                This allows him to be constantly in your face while chipping away at you with effective low and mid pokes.

        <div class="story1">
            <h4>
                The Mad lacks kicks for the most part but he uses sways for the designated 
                kick buttons. While pretty much every character has some form of CH fishing game, Steve is notoriously designed around it. 
                He has some of the best CH tools the game has to offer.

        <div class="story1">
            <h4>
                He has an unorthodox way of opening his opponent up as rather than relying on mid/low mixups to get damage, Steve relies 
                on using his powerful CH tools to score a big opening.

            <h4>
                The Drach is an okizeme monster. She has a strong poking game with tons of poke lows for various situations including hugely + hit, a ranged CH launcher 
                and a heavy hitting low in her stance.

                Her stance Art Of Phoenix (AOP) allows her to evade a lot of moves and offense from your opponent reducing their moveset 
                by a lot depending on the character. She's a character for lab monsters. Her small hitbox along with her evasive stance 
                can make her extremely hard to approach especially with her main mid poke going under highs.

            <h4>
                The Hunt is one of the most open-ended characters in the game, meaning he can be played in a variety of playstyles. His 
                offense is scary with strong low pokes that high crush, leaving him in the opponent’s face for followup pressure. It 
                can be difficult to mash and move out of Feng’s pressure.

        <div class="story1">
            <h4>
                Hunt has a low out of his sidestep that trips up opponents point blank for a combo, and he has plenty of strong mids to 
                complement him in this mixup scenario. He has a good selection of risk/reward situations so he can choose freely depending 
                on the situation.

        <div class="story1">
            <h4>
                The Kor is a bit of an extreme character. She has a very powerful but linear gameplan which suffers against those who 
                sidestep. This is because overall her tracking is weak. Very few of her moves track and her homing moves either lack 
                range or are slow. 
            </h4>
            
        </div>
        <div class="story1">
            <h4>
                However to make up for this weakness, she has the best sidestep in the game allowing her to get around sequences that 
                other characters can’t avoid. She can make the opponent hesitate and second guess their retaliation to her offense due 
                to the threat of her stepping and forcing them to whiff.

            <h4>
                The Hold has an extremely small moveset to work with to be effective. She is based around offensive pokes and likes to be 
                up in the opponent’s face to chip them down with her strong hitconfirm mids. She has good poke lows which leaves the 
                opponent in her face at a significant disadvantage.

                She can loop her poke situation over and over until you challenge her. The Hold has access
                 to a projectile which causes chip damage on block, not very useful but it’s a novelty.

                strings, to break them down bit by bit. She has a few moves which leaves her backturned. This gives her access to the one 
                of the most damaging combo starters in the game, as well as being hitconfirmable.
